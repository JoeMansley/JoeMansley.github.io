    <h1>What is time?</h1>
    
    Time is what I need <br>
    And time is what I've got <br>
    And time is always running <br>
    I think time will never stop<br>
    But time ain't really running; what's running is me<br>
    Time is boundless and static like the open sea<br>
    Except it's covered in ice<br>
    And I'm sliding it's like<br>
    I've got to hold on to anything I can for my life<br>
    But whatever I do I slide at the same speed: 1 second per second as measured by me<br>
    'Cause the sea's at a slope: nearly 90 degrees  <br>
    So I'm stuck on the ice; I'll never be freed<br>
    <br>
    But if I can build a jetpack <br>
    Maybe I can go back<br>
    Learn to fly, back in time<br>
    Doesn't mean I'll never die<br>
    But still, maybe it's worth a try.<br>
    <br>
    Answered the question, I have not<br>
    But that would require more time than I've got<br>
    So go read some Einstien or Wells, HG<br>
    Don't waste any more time listening to me.
